Via A Strategic Partnership With A Local Facility, We Will Start With 3 Hydro-Electric jadepuppy.io Powered And Natural-Water Cooled Servers With Endpoints In Areas Most In Need Of Mainnet Connectivity Over-all And Then Branch Out From There. Once These Nodes Are Synced, They Will Be Selectable By Users By Entering The Node Information Into Their Wallets. And Also For Use By Other Super Reps And Node Operators Within Their Config IP Lists. The https://api.jadepuppy.io Mainnet SuperNode And Node Network Will Provide gRPC Connectivity And Solidity Functionality To The Tron Main Network Strengthening The Over-all Processing Power Of The Network And At The Same Time Lowering The Over-all Carbon FootPrint. By Providing Verified Clean Energy Solutions

The Base Configuration For The First Clean Energy SuperNode Will Be 

We cool our data centers using a combination of Liebert CRAH (Computer Room Air Handler) units using chilled water from a central water plant, as well as a unique air-side economizer that was built and designed by Elon Green (GRNPC) and our technology partners. Our facility uses air-side economizers which allow us to operate at PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) values of less than 1.2 when the conditions outside and water-flow are appropriate.

Our facility also meets the most stringent industry compliance requirements including HIPAA, SSAE 16, PCI-DSS, and ISO 9001 & 27001, ensuring we provide our users with trusted, secure, and reliable clean energy solutions.
