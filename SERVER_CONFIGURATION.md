Elon Green Via A Strategic Technology Partnership With A Local Server Facility & JadePuppy, Will Start With 3 Hydro-Electric jadepuppy.io Powered And Natural-Water Cooled Servers. This Network Will Provide Endpoints In Areas Most In Need Of Mainnet Connectivity For Tron Over-all. We Will Branch Out From There As We Receive More Support From Other Node Providers And The Community To Help Provide Clean Energy Options Which Will Benefit All Users. Once Our Alpha Nodes Are Synced, They Can Be Initially Selected By Users By Entering The Node Information Into Their Wallet Settings. Our Hopes Of Being Officially Integrated As A Default Selectable Option For Mainnet Would Insure The HighestCause Less Confusion. This Clean Energy Option Is Also For Use By Other Super Reps And Node Operators Within Their Config IP/Port Lists. 

The https://api.jadepuppy.io Mainnet SuperNode And Node Network Will Provide gRPC Connectivity And Solidity Functionality To The Tron Main Network Strengthening The Over-all Processing Power Of The Network And At The Same Time Lowering The Over-all Carbon FootPrint. By Providing Verified Clean Energy Solutions

The Base Configuration For The First Clean Energy SuperNode Will Be As Follows:
# Rig Specifications
*  Cores - 24
*  Threads - 48
*  Base Frequency - 2.30 GHz
*  Turbo Frequency - 3.10 GHz
*  TDP - 120 W
*  RAM - 64GB
*  Storage - 1TB SSD + 2x2TB SSD RAID - 


We cool our data centers using a combination of Liebert CRAH (Computer Room Air Handler) units using chilled water, as well as a unique air-side economizer that was built and designed by Elon Green (GRNPC) and our technology partners. Our facility uses air-side economizers which allow us to operate at PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) values of less than 1.2 when the conditions outside and water-flow are appropriate.

Our facility also meets the most stringent industry compliance requirements including HIPAA, SSAE 16, PCI-DSS, and ISO 9001 & 27001, ensuring we provide our users with trusted, secure, and reliable clean energy solutions.

## We're Serious About Technology. We're Even More Serious About Using Technology To Make Sure Our Daily Processes Aren't Destroying The Environment By Making The Most Minimal Carbon Impact As Possible.
