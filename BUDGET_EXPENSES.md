Our hydro-electric powered data center dubbed "Jade Puppy" will provide clean energy low emissions supernodes, fullnode/solidity nodes for the tron network thus providing the first entry of clean energy consensus infrastructure represented by a Tron Super Representative. 

Many blockchains have recently fallen under heavy scrutiny from large corporations and institutes due to the nature in which energy is provided for consensus and other operations within nodes. Let's face it, we all need energy to thrive both in life and as a digital representative. It's everyone's responsibility to ensure that the energy we consume for our needs will not cause harm to the environment in the most avoidable way possible. Elon Green as a SR will provide tools to make the choice easier for user's to choose Hydro-Electric powered "JadePuppy" nodes when interacting with the tron blockchain.

The goal is to launch these nodes in regions where availability is currently the lowest, hence providing more comprehensible access to the tron network and its tools. We will start with 3 nodes in the most needy areas (Austrailia, Africa, South America, Northern Asia) and branch out from there. These areas are most suitable for our initial phase as they are in-line with our commitment to terra-form inhospitable environments into thriving clean energy producing/consuming communities.  We will invest our own time and financial resources for the initial infrastructure with hopes to eventually earn enough support from the community to sustain it and grow it across the world and beyond.
